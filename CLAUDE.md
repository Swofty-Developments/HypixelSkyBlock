# Claude Code Instructions

## Code Style

- **Minimal comments**: Do not add comments unless absolutely necessary. The codebase uses strong OOP, abstraction, and modular design - code should be self-explanatory through good naming and structure.
- Only add comments for truly complex algorithms or non-obvious business logic.
